Key features:
- Generates a unique session identifier for tracking project management activities
- Retrieves and displays your most recent project management sessions
- Shows active projects you're currently managing with status information
- Highlights high-priority tasks requiring attention
- Lists upcoming milestones with progress metrics
- Provides project health summaries with status indicators
- Identifies top project risks requiring mitigation
- Formats information in a structured, easy-to-read format
- Integrates with the loadcontext tool for deeper exploration
- Maintains continuity between project management sessions
- Displays status information through has_status relations
- Shows priority assignments through has_priority relations
- Presents task sequencing through precedes relations

Parameters explained:
No parameters required - the tool automatically retrieves all relevant context.

Return information:
- Session ID: A unique identifier for this project management session
- Recent Project Management Sessions: Up to 3 most recent sessions with:
  * Date
  * Project focus
  * Session summary (truncated for readability)
- Active Projects: List of current projects with:
  * Project name
  * Current status (via has_status relation)
  * Deadline information
- High-Priority Tasks: Up to 10 highest priority tasks with:
  * Task name
  * Associated project
  * Status (inactive, active, complete)
  * Priority (high via has_priority relation)
  * Assignee
- Upcoming Milestones: Up to 8 nearest milestones with:
  * Milestone name
  * Associated project
  * Due date
  * Completion percentage
  * Status (via has_status relation)
- Project Health Summary: Status of active projects with:
  * Project name
  * Health status indicator
  * Health score
  * Issue count
  * Risk count
- Top Project Risks: Up to 5 highest severity risks with:
  * Risk name
  * Associated project
  * Severity level
  * Impact assessment
- Next Sequence Tasks: Up to 5 tasks ready to be worked on next based on sequential dependencies:
  * Task name
  * Associated project
  * Status (via has_status relation)
  * Prerequisites completion status

Status and Priority Information:
- Project and task status is retrieved through has_status relations
- Valid status values include: inactive, active, complete
- Task priority is retrieved through has_priority relations
- Valid priority values include: high, low
- This information helps you prioritize your project management activities

Sequential Task Management:
- Tasks are presented in their logical sequence based on precedes relations
- Prerequisite tasks must be completed before dependent tasks can begin
- The sequential view helps identify the next logical actions in project workflows
- Critical path tasks are highlighted to show dependencies affecting project timelines

Session Workflow:
1. Start a project management session with startsession
2. Review the provided context to decide what to focus on
3. Use loadcontext to retrieve detailed information about specific projects
4. Conduct your project management work, adding new elements with buildcontext as needed
5. End the session when work is complete
6. Record progress, decisions, and next steps

You should:
- Begin each focused project management period with startsession
- Review recent sessions to maintain continuity in your work
- Prioritize work based on high-priority tasks and upcoming milestones
- Address projects with poor health indicators
- Mitigate high-severity risks promptly
- Focus on tasks that are next in sequence based on precedes relations
- Complete prerequisite tasks to unblock dependent tasks
- Check entity status to identify active work items
- Use the session ID when using other tools to maintain session tracking
- Establish a regular cadence of project management sessions
- Use the structured overview to make deliberate choices about where to focus your effort
- Consider creating or updating project entities after reviewing the current state
- Follow up on projects with approaching deadlines
