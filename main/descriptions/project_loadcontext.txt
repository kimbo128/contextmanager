A powerful tool for retrieving detailed contextual information about project entities, providing rich insights tailored to each entity type in the project management domain.

When to use this tool:
- Retrieving comprehensive information about projects, tasks, milestones, and team members
- Exploring task dependencies and critical path information
- Examining milestone progress and completion status
- Reviewing team member assignments and workload
- Analyzing resource allocation and availability
- Inspecting project risks and issues
- Preparing for project status updates and planning meetings
- Examining project timelines and progress metrics
- Getting a holistic view of project status and health
- Understanding relationships between project entities
- Viewing entity status information (inactive, active, complete)
- Checking priority levels for tasks and activities
- Understanding sequential relationships between tasks

Key features:
- Provides richly formatted, context-aware information about project management entities
- Adapts output format based on entity type (project, task, milestone, teamMember, resource)
- Presents both direct entity information and related elements
- Shows project metrics, task completion rates, and milestone progress
- Tracks entity views within the current project session
- Formats information in a structured, readable markdown format
- Highlights relationships between tasks, milestones, and team members
- Presents critical path information for task dependencies
- Shows resource utilization metrics and availability
- Displays status information via has_status relations
- Shows priority levels via has_priority relations
- Presents sequential relationships through precedes relations

Parameters explained:
1. entityName: Required - The name of the entity to retrieve context for
  - Example: "Marketing Campaign Q4", "Design Homepage", "Website Launch"
2. entityType: Optional - The type of entity being retrieved
  - Default: "project"
  - Helps the system format the output appropriately
  - Common types include: "project", "task", "milestone", "teamMember", "resource", "status", "priority"
3. sessionId: Optional - The current session identifier
  - Typically provided by startsession
  - Used for tracking entity views within the session

Each entity type returns specialized context information:
- Project: Shows project status (via has_status), description, timeline, budget, goal, tasks, milestones, issues, team members, risks, and task completion rate
- Task: Displays project affiliation, status (inactive, active, complete), priority (low, high), due date, assignee, description, critical path status, task dependencies, and task sequencing (preceding and following tasks)
- Milestone: Shows project affiliation, status (via has_status), date, completion criteria, description, progress percentage, days remaining, required tasks, and blocking tasks
- Team Member: Displays role, skills, availability, workload, assigned tasks, projects, upcoming deadlines, and overdue tasks
- Resource: Shows type, project affiliation, availability, capacity, cost, usage percentage, assigned tasks, and team members using the resource
- Status: Shows all entities assigned this status value, organized by entity type
- Priority: Shows all entities assigned this priority value, organized by entity type
- Other Entity Types: Shows basic entity information, observations, incoming relations, and outgoing relations

Status and Priority Information:
- All entity displays include status information when available via has_status relations
- Tasks and other prioritized elements show priority assignments via has_priority relations
- Valid status values include: inactive, active, complete
- Valid priority values include: high, low

Sequential Task Relationships:
- Task displays show preceding and following tasks through precedes relations
- Sequential relationships are visualized to show workflow between tasks
- Tasks display their position in the overall project workflow
- Critical path information highlights essential task sequences

Return information:
- Formatted markdown text with hierarchical structure
- Sections adapted to the specific entity type
- Related entities shown with their relationships
- Progress metrics and completion statistics where applicable
- Status and priority information prominently displayed
- Sequential relationships clearly indicated
- Error messages if the entity doesn't exist or can't be retrieved

You should:
- Specify the exact entity name for accurate retrieval
- Provide the entity type when possible for optimally formatted results
- Start with project entities to get a high-level overview
- Examine task context to understand dependencies and critical path
- Review milestone context to assess progress towards key deliverables
- Use team member context to evaluate workload and assignments
- Explore resource context to understand allocation and availability
- Check status entities to see all project elements at the same stage
- Review priority entities to identify critical project tasks
- Explore sequential relationships to understand task workflows
- After retrieving context, follow up on specific entities of interest
- Use in conjunction with startsession to maintain session tracking
- Remember that this tool only retrieves existing information; use buildcontext to add new entities
