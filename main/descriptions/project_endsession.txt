A multi-stage tool for documenting project management sessions, recording achievements, tracking task updates, and creating a structured record of project evolution.

When to use this tool:
- Concluding a project planning or review session
- Documenting decisions made during team meetings
- Recording updates to tasks and their status
- Tracking new tasks created during work sessions
- Documenting changes to project risk assessments
- Updating overall project status information
- Creating a structured record of project activities
- Establishing a formal conclusion to a focused work period
- Building a historical record of project development
- Preserving context for future team members or sessions

Key features:
- Provides a structured, multi-stage workflow for project session documentation
- Records project decisions and achievements in the knowledge graph
- Captures task status updates and progress information
- Tracks creation of new tasks with descriptions and priorities
- Documents risk updates with impact and probability assessments
- Updates project status information
- Maintains session continuity with unique session IDs
- Supports revision of previous stages when needed
- Offers a comprehensive assembly stage that consolidates all session information

The endsession tool uses a sequential, multi-stage approach with 6 typical stages:
1. Summary Stage: Records basic session information
2. Achievements Stage: Documents decisions and accomplishments
3. Task Updates Stage: Records changes to existing tasks
4. New Tasks Stage: Documents newly created tasks
5. Project Status Stage: Updates the overall project status
6. Risk Updates Stage: Documents changes to project risks
7. Assembly Stage: Consolidates all information and finalizes the session record

Parameters explained:
1. sessionId: Required - Unique identifier for the project session
  - Obtained from the startsession tool
  - Example: "proj_1234567890_abc123"
2. stage: Required - Current stage of the endsession workflow
  - Accepts: "summary", "achievements", "taskUpdates", "newTasks", "projectStatus", "riskUpdates", or "assembly"
  - Each stage has specific data requirements and processing logic
3. stageNumber: Required - The sequence number of the current stage
  - Starts at 1 and typically progresses through the stages
  - Used to track progress through the session documentation workflow
4. totalStages: Required - Total number of stages planned for this workflow
  - Typically 6-7 for the complete workflow
  - Provides context for the progress within the overall process
5. analysis: Optional - Text analysis or observations for the current stage
  - Descriptive text explaining the work done in this stage
  - Example: "Analyzed progress on the marketing campaign project"
6. stageData: Optional - Stage-specific structured data
  - Structure varies by stage type:
    * summary: { summary: "Session summary text", duration: "3 hours", project: "ProjectName" }
    * achievements: { achievements: ["Decision 1", "Accomplishment 2"] }
    * taskUpdates: { updates: [{ name: "Task1", status: "in_progress", progress: "50%" }] }
    * newTasks: { tasks: [{ name: "New Task", description: "Details", priority: "high" }] }
    * projectStatus: { projectStatus: "in_progress", projectObservation: "Good progress" }
    * riskUpdates: { risks: [{ name: "Risk1", status: "mitigated", impact: "medium", probability: "low" }] }
    * assembly: No stageData needed - automatically assembled from previous stages
7. nextStageNeeded: Required - Whether additional stages are needed after this one
  - Boolean value (true/false)
  - Set to false on the final stage to complete the session
8. isRevision: Optional - Whether this is revising a previous stage
  - Boolean value (true/false)
  - Default: false
9. revisesStage: Optional - If revising, which stage number is being revised
  - Required when isRevision is true
  - Indicates which previous stage is being updated

When the endsession workflow completes (assembly stage with nextStageNeeded: false), the tool performs these actions:
1. Records the session completion in persistent storage
2. Creates a summary of all documented information
3. Updates the project status in the knowledge graph
4. Links all achievements, task updates, and risk information

Return information:
- JSON response with the following structure when stages are in progress:
  * success: Boolean indicating whether the operation succeeded
  * stageCompleted: The stage that was just completed
  * nextStageNeeded: Whether more stages are required
  * stageResult: The processed result of the current stage
- Formatted markdown text summary when the session is completed, including:
  * Session date and project name
  * Decisions documented
  * Task updates
  * Project status
  * New tasks added
  * Risk updates
  * Session summary

You should:
- Complete all stages in order for comprehensive session documentation
- Provide specific details in each stage for accurate project documentation
- Specify task updates with clear status and progress information
- Include priority levels when adding new tasks
- Document all key decisions made during the session as achievements
- Include risk impact and probability when updating project risks
- If making a revision, specify which stage is being revised
- Only mark nextStageNeeded as false on the final assembly stage
- Review the final summary message to confirm all session details were recorded properly
- Use the unique session ID consistently across all stages
