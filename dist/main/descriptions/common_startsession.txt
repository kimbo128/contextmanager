It retrieves recent sessions, active work items, high-priority elements, and upcoming deadlines to help focus work effectively.

When to use this tool:
- Beginning a new work session in your domain
- Getting oriented to your current state across multiple projects/courses/research
- Planning which elements to focus on in the current session

Key features:
- Generates a unique session identifier for tracking activities
- Retrieves and displays recent sessions with summaries
- Formats domain-specific information in a structured, easy-to-read format

Parameters explained:
- No parameters required - the tool automatically retrieves all relevant context

Return information:
- Session ID: A unique identifier for this session
- Recent Sessions: Up to 3 most recent sessions with date, focus area, and session summary (truncated for readability)

Session workflow:
1. Starting a session creates a session identifier in the appropriate domain
2. This session can be referenced when loading context with loadcontext
3. Session activities are tracked for later recording
4. Sessions should be ended with endsession to record progress and accomplishments
5. Session history becomes available for future startsession calls

You should:
1. Begin each focused work period with startsession
2. Review the provided context to determine your focus
3. Choose specific elements to work on
4. Use the generated session ID with the loadcontext tool to load specific entities
5. End the session with endsession when work is complete
