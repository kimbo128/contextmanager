A powerful tool for retrieving rich, contextual information about domain-specific entities, providing formatted details tailored to each entity type.

When to use this tool:
- Retrieving detailed information about domain-specific entities
- Exploring relationships between connected entities
- Examining status information and progress metrics
- Understanding the structure and elements of complex entities
- Reviewing progress, completion, and deadline information
- Examining entity details, dependencies, and assignments
- Preparing for work on a specific entity by establishing context
- Analyzing knowledge graph connections to understand entity relationships
- Getting a holistic view of status, progress, and upcoming work
- Establishing context for effective planning and decision-making

Key features:
- Provides contextually rich, formatted information about domain-specific entities
- Adapts output format based on entity type
- Presents both direct entity information and related elements
- Organizes information in a clear, hierarchical structure
- Automatically identifies entity relationships and presents them systematically
- Tracks loaded entities within the current session for continuity
- Presents information in readable markdown format

Return information:
- Formatted markdown text with hierarchical structure
- Sections adapted to the specific entity type within each domain
- Related entities shown with their relationships and status information
- Progress metrics and completion statistics where applicable
- Error messages if the entity doesn't exist or can't be retrieved

You should:
- Specify the exact entity name for accurate retrieval
- Provide the entity type when possible for optimally formatted results
- Start with high-level entities (projects, courses) to get a broad overview
- Explore specific entities to understand details and relationships
- After retrieving context, follow up on specific entities of interest
- Use in conjunction with startsession to maintain session tracking
- Remember that this tool only retrieves existing information; use buildcontext to add new entities
