A precise tool for removing elements from the project management knowledge graph, enabling project managers to maintain data accuracy and refine their project structure as needs evolve.

When to use this tool:
- Removing completed or canceled projects or tasks
- Deleting erroneous relationships between project elements
- Clearing outdated observations from project entities
- Restructuring your project organization as the project evolves
- Removing team members who are no longer part of the project
- Correcting relationships between tasks, milestones, and resources
- Cleaning up the knowledge graph during project phase transitions
- Eliminating deprecated risks or issues that are no longer relevant
- Removing preliminary project elements that have been superseded
- Reorganizing your project structure by removing and recreating elements
- Updating status assignments when task or project states change
- Modifying priority levels as project needs shift
- Restructuring sequential relationships between tasks and activities

Key features:
- Provides targeted deletion capabilities for three distinct types of knowledge graph elements: entities, relations, and observations
- Maintains knowledge graph integrity during deletion operations
- Supports batch deletion of multiple items in a single operation
- Returns clear confirmation of deletion results
- Preserves the overall structure of the project knowledge graph while removing specific elements
- Performs validation to ensure deletion requests are properly formatted
- Handles status and priority relation management
- Supports modification of task sequencing relationships

Parameters explained:
1. type: The type of deletion operation to perform
  - Accepts: "entities", "relations", or "observations"
  - Determines how the data parameter is interpreted
2. data: The elements to remove from the knowledge graph (structure varies by type):
  - For "entities": Array of entity names to delete
    * Example: ["Task_A", "Milestone_1"]
  - For "relations": Array of relation objects, each containing:
    * from: Name of the source entity
    * to: Name of the target entity
    * relationType: Type of relationship to remove (e.g., "part_of", "has_status", "has_priority", "precedes")
    * Example: [{ "from": "Task_A", "to": "Milestone_1", "relationType": "part_of" }]
  - For "observations": Array of objects, each containing:
    * entityName: Name of the entity to remove observations from
    * observations: Array of specific observations to remove
    * Example: [{ "entityName": "Project_X", "observations": ["duration:3 months", "budget:10000"] }]

Deletion behavior by type:
- Entities: Removes the specified entities and all their associated relations from the knowledge graph
- Relations: Removes only the specified relationships, leaving the connected entities intact
- Observations: Removes specific observations from entities while preserving the entities themselves

Status and Priority Management:
- When deleting status or priority entities, be aware that all has_status or has_priority relations using these entities will be removed
- For changing an entity's status, delete the existing has_status relation before creating a new one
- For changing priority, delete the existing has_priority relation before creating a new one
- Status values (inactive, active, complete) are managed through relations, not direct properties
- Priority values (low, high) are managed through relations, not direct properties

Sequential Task Management:
- Removing precedes relations will affect task sequencing and dependencies
- When reorganizing project tasks, update all affected precedes relations
- Consider the impact on project timelines when modifying sequential relationships

Safety considerations:
- Entity deletion is permanent and will also remove all relationships involving those entities
- Consider exporting or backing up your project knowledge graph before performing large-scale deletions
- For sensitive operations, consider removing specific observations rather than entire entities
- When removing key project elements, consider the impact on your overall project structure
- Status changes should be carefully managed to maintain accurate project tracking
- Changes to task sequences may affect dependent project activities

Return information:
- JSON response indicating success or failure
- For successful operations:
  - Success flag set to true
  - Confirmation message with count of deleted items
    * For entities: "Deleted X entities"
    * For relations: "Deleted X relations"
    * For observations: "Deleted observations from X entities"
- For failed operations:
  - Success flag set to false
  - Error message describing the issue

You should:
- Be specific in your deletion requests to avoid unintended data loss
- Use relations deletion when you want to disconnect entities without removing them
- For observations, provide the exact observations to ensure only the intended content is removed
- When restructuring your project, consider how deletions will affect related elements
- Use deletecontext in conjunction with buildcontext to refine and evolve your project structure
- Regularly review your knowledge graph for elements that may need to be removed or updated
- Consider the cascading effects of entity deletion on your overall project structure
- Delete completed tasks and milestones systematically when closing project phases
- Remove resolved risks and issues to keep your project status current
- When updating entity status, delete the old has_status relation before creating a new one
- When updating entity priority, delete the old has_priority relation before creating a new one
- Maintain logical consistency when modifying sequential task relationships
