  - For "priority": Object containing:
    * priorityValue: The priority value to filter by (e.g., "high", "low")
  - For "sequence": Object containing:
    * taskName: Name of the task to analyze sequential relationships for

Operation details:
- graph: Returns the complete project knowledge graph with all entities and relationships
- search: Performs text-based search across entity names and observations
- nodes: Retrieves detailed information about specific entities by name
- project: Returns comprehensive project information including tasks, milestones, and team members
- dependencies: Maps task dependencies to identify critical paths and bottlenecks
- assignments: Lists all assignments for a specific team member with workload information
- milestones: Tracks milestone progress with completion status and metrics
- timeline: Generates a project timeline with key dates, dependencies, and current status
- resources: Analyzes resource allocation across project activities
- risks: Identifies and prioritizes project risks with mitigation strategies
- related: Finds connections between projects for portfolio management
- decisions: Retrieves decision log for project governance and audit
- health: Assesses project health with key performance indicators and metrics
- status: Retrieves all entities with a specific status value (inactive, active, complete)
- priority: Retrieves all entities with a specific priority value (high, low)
- sequence: Identifies sequential relationships for tasks, showing preceding and following tasks

Status and Priority Information:
- Status queries return entities organized by their current state in the project lifecycle
- Priority queries help identify critical project tasks and elements
- Status values include: inactive, active, complete
- Priority values include: high, low
- Status and priority are assigned through has_status and has_priority relations

Sequential Task Information:
- Sequence queries identify tasks that come before or after in a project workflow
- Sequential relationships help visualize the project workflow and dependencies
- The sequence operation shows both incoming and outgoing precedes relations
- Task sequences are critical for project planning and critical path identification

Return information:
- success: Boolean indicating whether the operation succeeded
- Additional fields depend on the operation type:
  * graph: Complete knowledge graph
  * results: For search operations
  * nodes: For specific entity retrieval
  * project/dependencies/assignments/etc.: For specialized views
  * status/priority: Lists of entities with specified status/priority values
  * sequence: Preceding and following tasks in project workflows

You should:
- Start with broad queries ("graph", "search") to explore your project portfolio
- Use specific entity queries ("nodes", "project") for detailed information
- Map task dependencies to identify critical paths and bottlenecks
- Track team member assignments to manage workload and availability
- Monitor milestone progress to ensure project timeline adherence
- Generate project timelines for planning and tracking purposes
- Analyze resource allocation to optimize utilization
- Identify and prioritize project risks for proactive management
- Find relationships between projects for portfolio-level insights
- Review decision logs for governance and accountability
- Assess project health regularly with the health operation
- Use status queries to filter entities by their current state
- Use priority queries to focus on high-priority items
- Use sequence queries to understand task workflows and dependencies
- Combine multiple operations to build comprehensive project dashboards
