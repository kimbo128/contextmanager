Delete Context Tool

A precise tool for removing elements from domain-specific knowledge graphs.
This tool allows targeted deletion of entities, relationships between entities, or specific observations from existing entities.
It helps maintain an accurate and current representation of the context as work evolves.

When to use this tool:
- Removing deprecated, completed, or incorrect entities
- Deleting obsolete or erroneous relationships between entities
- Pruning outdated observations that no longer apply
- Correcting errors in the knowledge graph
- Cleaning up test or prototype elements
- Maintaining graph accuracy as work scope changes
- Removing sensitive or confidential information
- Reorganizing your domain structure by removing and recreating elements

Key features:
- Three distinct deletion operation types (entities, relations, observations)
- Cascading deletion for entities (automatically removes related relations)
- Precise deletion of specific observations without removing entire entities
- Targeted relation removal with exact matching on from/to/type
- Batch operations for efficient cleanup
- JSON-formatted response with operation results
- Secure validation before deletion
- Clear error messages when operations fail

Parameters explained:
- type: The deletion operation type to perform, which must be one of:
  * "entities" - Remove entities and their relations
  * "relations" - Remove specific relationships between entities
  * "observations" - Remove specific observations from entities
- data: Operation-specific data structure:
  * For "entities": Array of entity names to delete
    - Example: ["ProjectX", "Task123", "Course101"]
  * For "relations": Array of objects with { from, to, relationType }
    - Example: [{ "from": "ProjectX", "to": "Task123", "relationType": "contains" }]
  * For "observations": Array of objects with { entityName, observations[] }
    - Example: [{ "entityName": "ProjectX", "observations": ["status:completed", "priority:high"] }]

Deletion behavior by type:
- "entities": Completely removes the specified entities and any relations where they appear
- "relations": Removes only the exact relations specified, matching on all three attributes
- "observations": Removes specific observations from entities while preserving the entities themselves

Safety considerations:
- Entity deletion cascades to relations, so be careful when deleting key entities
- There is no "undo" operation, so confirm deletions carefully
- Partial graph information can lead to inconsistent views
- Relations require entities on both ends to exist
- Consider exporting or backing up your knowledge graph before large-scale deletions

Return information:
- JSON response indicating success or failure
- For successful operations:
  * Success flag set to true
  * Confirmation message with count of deleted items
- For failed operations:
  * Success flag set to false
  * Error message describing the issue

You should:
1. Identify the specific elements that need to be removed
2. Choose the appropriate deletion type (entities, relations, or observations)
3. Structure your data according to the deletion type's requirements
4. Start with the most specific deletions (observations) before broader ones
5. Verify the entities or relations exist before attempting deletion
6. Check the operation result to confirm successful deletion
7. Consider documenting major deletions as observations on related entities
8. When removing an entire project/course/research component, first delete its sub-elements for cleaner removal
9. Use deletecontext in conjunction with buildcontext to refine and evolve your knowledge structure
10. Regularly review your knowledge graph for elements that may need to be removed or updated
