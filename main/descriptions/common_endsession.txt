A multi-stage tool for documenting domain-specific sessions, recording progress, tracking updates, and creating a structured record of work in the knowledge graph.

When to use this tool:
Only use this tool when the user explicitly requests it or provides explicit approval.

Key features:
- Provides a structured, multi-stage workflow for session documentation
- Records accomplishments/learnings in the knowledge graph
- Updates status of tracked elements based on progress
- Creates connections between related entities
- Updates overall project/course/research status and metadata
- Creates new elements for future work
- Supports revision of previous stages when needed
- Offers a comprehensive assembly stage that consolidates all session information
- Organizes activity into a coherent history

The endsession tool uses a sequential, multi-stage approach with typical stages varying by domain:
- Developer (6 stages): Summary, Achievements, Task Updates, New Tasks, Project Status, Assembly
- Student (6 stages): Summary, Concepts Learned, Assignment Updates, New Concepts, Course Status, Assembly
- Qualitative Research (7 stages): Summary, Interview Data, Memos, Coding Activity, Themes, Project Status, Assembly
- Quantitative Research (8 stages): Summary, Dataset Updates, New Analyses, New Visualizations, Hypothesis Results, Model Updates, Project Status, Assembly
- Project Management (7 stages): Summary, Achievements, Task Updates, New Tasks, Project Status, Risk Updates, Assembly

    * All domains:
      - assembly: No stageData needed - automatically assembled from previous stages
7. nextStageNeeded: Required - Whether additional stages are needed after this one
  - Boolean value (true/false)
  - Set to false on the final stage to complete the session
8. isRevision: Optional - Whether this is revising a previous stage
  - Boolean value (true/false)
  - Default: false
9. revisesStage: Optional - If revising, which stage number is being revised
  - Required when isRevision is true
  - Indicates which previous stage is being updated

When the endsession workflow completes (assembly stage with nextStageNeeded: false), the tool performs domain-specific updates to the knowledge graph:
- Developer: Achievement entities, task status updates, project status updates, new task creation
- Student: Concept entities, assignment status updates, course status updates, new concept creation
- Qualitative Research: Interview records, memo creation, coding and theme organization, project status updates
- Quantitative Research: Dataset updates, statistical analyses, visualizations, hypothesis results, model updates, project status
- Project Management: Achievement entities, task status updates, project status updates, new task creation, risk updates

Return information:
- JSON response with the following structure:
  * success: Boolean indicating whether the operation succeeded
  * stageCompleted: The stage that was just completed
  * nextStageNeeded: Whether more stages are required
  * stageResult: The processed result of the current stage
  * endSessionArgs: (Only in assembly stage) Consolidated arguments for the session
  * sessionRecorded: (Final stage only) Whether the session was recorded
  * summaryMessage: (Final stage only) Formatted summary of all recorded information
  * error: (Only on failure) Error message describing the issue

You should:
- Complete all stages in order for comprehensive session documentation
- Provide specific details in each stage for accurate knowledge graph updates
- Be precise about names of entities to ensure they match existing entities
- Use clear, descriptive names for any new entities
- Include relevant observations for status updates
- If making a revision, specify which stage is being revised
- Only mark nextStageNeeded as false on the final assembly stage
- Review the final summary message to confirm all session details were recorded properly
- Use the unique session ID consistently across all stages
